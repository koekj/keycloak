    <title>Error Handling</title>
    <para>
        Keycloak has some error handling facilities for servlet based client adapters.  When an error is encountered in
        authentication, keycloak will call <literal>HttpServletResponse.sendError()</literal>.  You can set up an error-page
        within your <literal>web.xml</literal> file to handle the error however you want.  Keycloak may throw
        400, 401, 403, and 500 errors.

    <para>
        Keycloak also sets an <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal> attribute that you can retrieve.  The attribute name
        is <literal>org.keycloak.adapters.spi.AuthenticationError</literal>.  Typecast this object to:
        <literal>org.keycloak.adapters.saml.SamlAuthenticationError</literal>.  This class can tell you exactly what happened.
        If this attribute is not set, then the adapter was not responsible for the error code.
